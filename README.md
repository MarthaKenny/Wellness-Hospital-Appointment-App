## CAPSTONE PROJECT: CLINIC APPOINTMENT APP.

It was an awesome experience at Microsoft #30Daysoflearning, Power platform Track.
I had the opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge into 4 of he 5 low-code/no-code development tools that make up Microsoft's Power Platform - Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages, and Power Virtual Agents.

At the end of the program i was able to combine two of these tools into a real life solution.
For my Capstone Project i decided to build an App. A clinic Appointment Application for a hypothetical (Wellness Hospital)
## PROBLEM STATEMENT.
I'm a 4th year medical student at university of Ilorin, Ilorin, Nigeria.. As a clinical student who has spent considerably time at the hospital I have seen how patients crowd themselves up every clinic day in order to see a doctor. Most of these patients spends about 8-10 hours waiting to see the doctors and some still end up not seeing the doctor. This is not appropriate, as a Clinic Appointment is not an emergency where one has to be attended to As soon as possible. I noticed this problem and I thought that I could create an app which could eliminate this waste of time and resource.
 ## PROJECT OVERVIEW - About The App 
It is an appointment app where the patients can choose a convenient time for their clinic visit in the available office time.
SharePoint is used as primary Database for this App

Power Automate is used within the App environment to Send an email to the patients Confirming their appointment date and time.

On this page the patient can fill their details which includes Name, Age, Gender, Department of the hospital they want to visit (Medical, surgerical etc) And can also choose the Available clinic days that will suit them.

All these information is immediately stored in the SharePoint and the admin can make a real time list of patients appointment for the upcoming clinics.

Once a clinic date and time has been selected, Patients will have to choose next available time.
This will considerably stop the time patients waste at the hospital just waiting to see the doctor.

## APP AUTOMATION.
I extended the capability of the PowerApp by leveraging PowerAutomate automating an email response to the patients emails ensuring these patients get notified immediately their appointment are received and recorded.

## CHALLENGES.
I encountered these problems

1. In creating the SharePoint list I wanted to create a drop down  list showing available time for each department each person chooses to visit and not having to show all the available department clinic days at once.

2. I wanted to ensure once a maximum number has chosen a time, that time wouldn't be available for others to choose automatically. I couldn't do that too. I had to ensure specific response instead.

Moving forward i plan on increasing my proficiency in using the Power platform  Shart point list creation and find a way to solve these Issues.
## RECOMMENDATIONS.
I hope health institutions will use an app like this to make patients experience better and less stressful.
